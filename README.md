# Jason Perception Filter
Master's project to create a mechanism for reducing the reasoning time in the Jason language.

This implementation extends Jason 1.4.1 with a perception filter based on an XML file.
To compile and run this Jason version, the files compile.sh and run8.sh are provided.
The original ways of compiling Jason can also be used.

An example of filter is provided in the environment folder.

Suggestions or bugs found, please report to mstabile@ime.usp.br.
